# Latency Monitoring Module
The latency_monitoring module is designed to monitor system latency in a Linux environment and output latency top attributes. This module provides insights into latency patterns, allowing users to analyze the most active contributors to latency and prevalent latency values.

# How to Use
To utilize the module, follow these steps:

- sudo insmod latency_monitoring.ko DELAY_MS=<delay_in_ms>
- DELAY_MS: Specifies the delay in milliseconds between consecutive latency measurements.
### Parameters
- DELAY_MS: Delay after which the latency measurements are repeated in milliseconds. The default delay is set to 50 milliseconds.
# How It Works
The module employs a workqueue mechanism to handle latency monitoring in the background. Key functionalities include:

### Latency Measurement
The work_handler function captures and displays latency attributes, including backtrace, count, time, and maximum latency.

- Backtrace       Count          Time           Max
- %pX             %10.u          %10.lu        %10.lu
### Initialization
During initialization, the module sets up the workqueue, schedules the initial work execution, and validates the provided delay parameter.

### Cleanup
Upon module removal, the scheduled tasks in the work queue are canceled, and the work queue is destroyed.

# Notes
The latency information is output through the kernel log using printk.
Ensure that the id3v2 command, part of the id3lib-tools package, is installed on your system before using the module.
Customize the module based on your specific requirements and datasets.
Exercise caution when working with kernel modules, as they can have a significant impact on system behavior.
