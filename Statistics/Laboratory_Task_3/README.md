# KENO Lottery Analysis

This task examines the "KENO" lottery, where participants choose numbers from a field of 70. Players decide how many numbers to pick (2 to 10) and their wager (1, 2, 5, or 10 Euros). Out of the 70, 20 winning numbers are drawn, and payouts are determined by the matches.### Field with 10 Boxes:
For a player selecting 10 boxes with a €1 wager in KENO, the expected value is approximately -1.0120, with a variance of 18735.7766 and a standard deviation of 136.8787.

### Other Fields:
The expected values and standard deviations for winnings when marking 9 to 2 boxes in a KENO play with a €1 wager vary, reflecting different risk-reward profiles.

### Maximizing Winning Odds:
To maximize the expected value of KENO winnings, a player should mark 3 boxes in each play.

### Individual Task:
In addressing the specific question in "sr_aufg_3d_xy.txt" in "Endziffer_xy," the probability of exactly 9 losses out of 12 plays, each resulting in a €2 loss, 
is approximately 0.0968. The calculation involves using the hypergeometric distribution and binomial distribution.

# Notes:

The analysis provides insights into expected values and risks for different KENO playing approaches.
Strategies align with specified winnings and probabilities.
The optimal strategy for maximizing expected value involves marking 3 boxes in each field.
