# Age Distribution Analysis

This statistical analysis task involves assessing the age distribution among employees of the NANUAG company. 
The dataset, located in the sr_aufg_1_xy.txt file within the Endziffer_xy subdirectory, contains information such as personal number, gender, first name, last name, and birth date.

## Objective:
Analyze the age distribution of NANUAG employees and perform the following tasks:

## 1. Data Import:
Read the data into Python or a Jupyter Notebook, storing it in a Pandas DataFrame. Avoid displaying the complete dataset but use functions like dataframe.head(x) for previewing.

## 2. Data Cleansing:
Conduct data cleansing operations, removing or correcting entries as necessary. Create a table summarizing deleted and corrected records, specifying the alterations made.

## 3. Age Calculation:
Compute the age of employees as of December 31, 2005. Age should be expressed in completed years.

## 4. Age Distribution Visualization:
Present the age distribution of employees through a grouped bar chart, segregating by gender. Define age classes as follows: up to 20 years, 21–30 years, 31–40 years, 41–50 years, and over 50 years.

## 5. Pie Charts for Gender-Specific Age Distribution:
Illustrate the age distribution of male and female employees separately using pie charts. Annotate each sector with the corresponding percentage.

## 6. Key Metrics:
Calculate and present key metrics, including mean, empirical variance, empirical standard deviation, median, and range, both for all employees and categorized by gender.

These analyses aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the age composition among NANUAG employees, offering valuable insights for strategic workforce planning.
