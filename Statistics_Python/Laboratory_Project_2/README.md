# Population Dynamics Analyzer

The Population Dynamics Analyzer is a Python-based tool developed for examining the demographic trends in the United States. 
It focuses on the population data provided in the file sr_aufg_2_xy.txt to gain insights into the country's historical and future population changes.

# How It Works:

### Data Import: 
The tool reads the population data into a Pandas DataFrame, allowing for efficient manipulation and analysis.

### Scatter Plot: 
It generates a scatter plot to visually represent the population development over the years.

### Regression Curves: 
The program explores various regression curves, including linear, polynomial (2nd and 3rd degree), logarithmic, and exponential functions, to model the population trends accurately.

### Best Fit Selection: 
After evaluating different regression options, the tool helps in selecting the most suitable regression curve by considering factors like simplicity, accuracy, and consistency with historical data.

### Visualization: 
The chosen regression curve is overlaid onto the scatter plot to provide a clear representation of the population trend.

### 2030 Population Prediction: 
Using the selected regression model, the tool predicts the population of the United States for the year 2030. It considers potential numerical issues to ensure realistic and reliable predictions.
